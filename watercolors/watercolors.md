# Self-Generated Watercolors

This is a project that will combine my own watercolor paintings with software to create a "template" that can create categories of watercolors with the click of a button, based in my personal style.

It's sort of been an interesting way for me to think about generative art lately. To think about generative art as a way to build a template that you can then iterate from.

## Requirements

Knowledge of generative art models, such as Stable Diffusion, Dall-E, MidJourney.

Perhaps knowledge and ability to use all three could be interesting variants on the project. I could probably do the project in parallel with working through, but maybe in a multi-tiered way.
